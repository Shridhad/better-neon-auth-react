## Design Principles (Linear-inspired)
1. **Minimal and Clean**: Reduce visual noise, focus on content
2. **Purposeful Motion**: Subtle, meaningful animations
3. **Typography-first**: Clear hierarchy, readable fonts
4. **Muted Colors**: Grays as primary, accent colors sparingly
5. **Keyboard-friendly**: Support keyboard navigation
6. **Speed**: Fast, responsive interactions

## Git Workflow
Each completed task will be committed separately with a descriptive commit message.
